```

## Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Required Core Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-custom-jwt-secret-here
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/businessSearchApp?retryWrites=true&w=majority
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key

# Required Demo Mode Configuration
DEMO_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your-demo-google-places-api-key
DEMO_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-demo-openai-api-key
DEMO_MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/businessSearchApp?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Optional Development Settings
NODE_ENV=development
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Demo Mode Environment Variables
The demo mode requires the owner's API keys to provide free searches:
- `DEMO_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`: Powers guest business searches
- `DEMO_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Enables AI suggestions for guests  
- `DEMO_MONGODB_URI`: Stores guest search data (90-day cleanup)

**Important**: These demo keys are separate from user API keys and have usage monitoring to prevent abuse.
