## API Key Management System

The application requires users to provide ALL their own API keys with **no fallbacks** to environment variables:

### Required User API Keys
- **Google Places API Key** - Required for all business searches
- **OpenAI API Key** - Required for AI-powered search features  
- **MongoDB Atlas URI** - Required for data storage (users provide their own database)

### No Environment Variable Fallbacks
- The application will **NOT** use any server-level API keys as fallbacks
- All users must configure their own complete set of API keys
- If any required API key is missing, the respective features will not work
- Authentication is required - users must register/login to use any search features

### User-Level Keys (Required)
- All users must provide their own API keys through the Account Portal
- All three API keys are mandatory for the application to function
- Users manage their own API costs and usage limits
- Each user's data is stored in their own MongoDB Atlas database
- Complete privacy and individual usage control

## Features

### Advanced Search Capabilities
- **Single Location Search**: Search businesses in a specific city/location with radius control
- **State-wide Search**: Search across top 100+ cities in any US state
- **AI-Powered Search Terms**: OpenAI generates intelligent search terms based on job roles
- **Smart Caching**: 48-hour result caching prevents duplicate API calls and reduces costs

### Business Management
- Save businesses to personal lists with custom names
- Mark businesses as "bad leads" to filter them out
- Add custom notes and career page links
- Export results to CSV format
- Import businesses from CSV files with intelligent duplicate detection
- Advanced duplicate detection using normalized business names and websites

### Multi-User Support
- User registration and authentication with JWT tokens
- Individual API key management per user
- Personal business lists isolated between users
- Secure data separation in MongoDB

### Performance & Cost Optimization
- **Search Fingerprinting**: Generates unique hashes for search parameters
- **Intelligent Caching**: Stores complete search results for 48 hours
- **Automatic Cache Cleanup**: MongoDB TTL indexes remove expired cache entries
- **Cache Age Indicators**: Shows users how old cached results are
- **Cross-User Cache Sharing**: Identical searches by different users share cached results

## Deployment

### Replit Deployment (Recommended)
1. Fork this repository to Replit
2. Set environment variables in Replit Secrets:
   - `MONGODB_URI` (required)

app.use('/api/', rateLimiter);
```

#### **Security Headers (Helmet.js)**
```typescript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: true,
  crossOriginEmbedderPolicy: false,
  // ... full CSP configuration
}));
```

#### **CORS Protection**
```typescript
app.use(cors({
  origin: production ? ['https://yourdomain.com'] : ['http://localhost:*'],
  credentials: true
}));
```

#### **Input Validation & Sanitization**
```typescript
// API keys validated for correct format
// Search terms sanitized for external API calls
// MongoDB URIs validated for security patterns
```

### **üîí API Key Security**

#### **Encryption at Rest**
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with random IV
- **Key Management**: Derived from ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable
